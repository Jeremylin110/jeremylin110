	<p id="Rustin"> I have three main hobbies, one of my hobbies is baseball. I love to play it for fun and in competition. 
	Additionaly, I like to play with my family and friends. Another of my hobbies is to play video games. I love multiplayer
	games because of the competition and the satisfaction of winning. My last main hobby is drawing, I love drawing because 
	I like toning on details and seeing the final product. Sometimes, I like to create collections of drawings of things I
	like.
