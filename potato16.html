	<p id="justin"> Goals: </p>
	<p id="kk"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have two main goals, the first one is to get into Hunter High School. I want to get into Hunter because it
	is a good school and it strives me to work hard. I want to be set up great so I can do better in the future. Another
	goal that I have is to get better at baseball. I am extremely dedicated to baseball and I am on two teams. I plan
	to work everyday and get even better. </p>
